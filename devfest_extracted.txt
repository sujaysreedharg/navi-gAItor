Code of Conduct
San Francisco| Fremont
Be excellent to each other.
Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone 
deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience 
without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant 
or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you 
are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.
Speak up if you see or hear something.
Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when 
you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may 
not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their 
attention is encouraged.
Practice saying "Yes and" to each other.
It’s a theatre improv technique to build on each other’s ideas. 
We all benefit when we create together.

Content Slides
Full screen slides
Use full-screen slides whenever it makes the most sense for the 
content you’re creating. The extra slide real estate for full-screen 
allows for larger graphics and larger text.
If you’re doing a VO or designing a full-screen animated video, 
you would use this layout for every slide in your deck.


● Bullet one goes here
● Bullet two goes here and can be freakishly 
long, but avoid when possible
● Add space after list item for main bullets
● Bullets should have 1.5 line spacing
○ Sub bullet, yay!
○ Oh sweet, another one

Half screen speaker
Presenter slides are a great way to engage your 
audience by showing the presenter on on the 
right half of the screen and graphics on the left.
When designing presenter slides make sure your 
graphics never cross the centerline. This will 
make sure there is enough space to fit both the 
presenter and the graphic.
If your content is too large to fit on a presenter 
slide or is better for the learner with more space, 
please use a full-screen slide instead.
